After investigating I ensured my reverse payload was not been dectected by the anti-virus, but the issue persisted\nI tried the TCP Meterpreter Shell and that resolved the issue, could be the related to network conditions affecting the HTTPS connection as a result the payload wasn\u0026rsquo;t a good fit for that environment\nLeason learned if a specific payload doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, try a different one\nBut this issue lead me to further investigate and see what could be on my control to improve the connection and I found I could set the following parameters for the meterpreter sessions\nComm Timeout (Communication timeout) Retry Total Time Retry Wait Time You will have to experiment with the values until you reach the one that best suitable for the network environment I recommend to use Only if you already have attempted to change payloads and you still have issues\nThe command # set_timeouts -x 0 -c 100000 -w 2500 -t 100000 Flag and meaning # The -x stands for Expiration Timeout The -c stands for Communication Timeout The -w stands for Retry Wait Time the -t stands for Retry Total Time To view the results of newly configured settings run the following command # get_timeouts Reference: Metasploit Timeout control\n","date":"2 March 2024","permalink":"/posts/postsec/meterpreter_shell_timeout/","section":"Posts","summary":"A year ago while testing a https reverse meterpreter shell after a 15 or 30 minutes the meterpreter session would die.","title":"Meterpreter Session Time out"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/posts/postsec/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Offensive Security Posts"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/categories/offensivesecurity/","section":"Categories","summary":"","title":"OffensiveSecurity"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/posts/","section":"Posts","summary":"","title":"Posts"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/powershell/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Powershell"},{"content":"While training Red Teaming or Penetration Test hacking on plataforms like Hack the Box or previous offensive security training like OSCP or OSEP\nOne thing I noticed is during lateral movement through pivoting between the machines if I had to perform port scan enumeration on hosts located on different subnet/network utilizing proxychain+nmap or chisel+nmap, that was very painful and a nightmare\nNmap + Proxychains or Nmap + chisel did not work very well for me and for that reason i came up with something different and that was to leverage what native powershell has to offer, but for the offensive security side of it\nIf you have to scan large amount of ports even twerking the settings in nmap and proxychains will not give much gains compared to powershell. Below is a small snipped of powershell code that I developed and used multiple times during my training days that helped me and saved me a lot of time\nMy personal opnion on powershell is an awesome tool and one should master and be used as Read Teamer or Penetration Tester\nPowershell Port Scan Code # I used Runspace feature in powershell that allows to run multiple commands by creating new threads on existing process. The CreateRunSpacePool values 1,100 means mininum and maximum number of threads allowed to run at the same time. The AddScript is where you add the desired code to run\n$RunspacePool = [runspacefactory]::CreateRunspacePool(1,100) $RunspacePool.Open() $PowerShell = [powershell]::Create() $PowerShell.RunspacePool = $RunspacePool $PowerShell.AddScript({1..65535 | ForEach-Object { if((New-Object System.Net.Sockets.TcpClient).ConnectAsync(\u0026#34;YOUR_IP_HERE\u0026#34;,$_).wait(100)){write-host \u0026#34;Port $_ is opened\u0026#34;}}}) $Jobs = $PowerShell.BeginInvoke() If you want to go beyond you can improve the code snippet to run on multiple ips or creating a script that accept IP as an argument\n","date":"2 March 2024","permalink":"/posts/postsec/powershellscan/","section":"Posts","summary":"While training Red Teaming or Penetration Test hacking on plataforms like Hack the Box or previous offensive security training like OSCP or OSEP","title":"Powershell Port Scan"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/programming/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Programming"},{"content":"","date":null,"permalink":"/tags/","section":"Tags","summary":"","title":"Tags"},{"content":"Legal Disclaimer # All content of this blog related to CyberSecurity is for educational insights.
